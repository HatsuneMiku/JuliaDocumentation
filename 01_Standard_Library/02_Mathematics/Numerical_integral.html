      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Numerically integrate the
function f(x) from a to b,
and optionally over additional intervals b to c and so on. Keyword
options include a relative error tolerance reltol (defaults to
sqrt(eps) in the precision of the endpoints), an absolute error
tolerance abstol (defaults to 0), a maximum number of function
evaluations maxevals (defaults to 10^7), and the order of the
integration rule (defaults to 7).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returns a pair (I,E) of the estimated integral I and
an estimated upper bound on the absolute error E. If maxevals is not
exceeded then E &lt;= max(abstol, reltol*norm(I)) will hold. (Note that
it is useful to specify a positive abstol in cases where norm(I) may be
zero.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The endpoints a etcetera can also be complex (in
which case the integral is performed over straight-line segments in the
complex plane). If the endpoints are BigFloat, then the integration
will be performed in BigFloat precision as well (note: it is advisable
to increase the integration order in rough proportion to the precision,
for smooth integrands). More generally, the precision is set by the
precision of the integration endpoints (promoted to floating-point
types).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The integrand f(x) can return any numeric scalar,
vector, or matrix type, or in fact any type supporting +, -,
multiplication by real values, and a norm (i.e., any normed vector
space). Alternatively, a different norm can be specified by passing a
norm-like function as the norm keyword argument (which defaults to
vecnorm).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Only one-dimensional integrals are provided by this
function. For multi-dimensional integration (cubature), there are many
different algorithms (often much better than simple nested 1d
integrals) and the optimal choice tends to be very problem-dependent.
See the Julia external-package listing for available algorithms for
multidimensional integration or other specialized tasks (such as
integrals of highly oscillatory or singular functions).]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The algorithm is an adaptive Gauss-Kronrod
integration technique: the integral in each interval is estimated using
a Kronrod rule (2*order+1 points) and the error is estimated using an
embedded Gauss rule (order points). The interval with the largest error
is then subdivided into two intervals and the process is repeated until
the desired error tolerance is achieved.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These quadrature rules work best for smooth
functions within each interval, so if your function has a known
discontinuity or other singularity, it is best to subdivide your
interval to put the singularity at an endpoint. For example, if f has a
discontinuity at x=0.7 and you want to integrate from 0 to 1, you
should use quadgk(f, 0,0.7,1) to subdivide the interval at the point of
discontinuity. The integrand is never evaluated exactly at the
endpoints of the intervals, so it is possible to integrate functions
that diverge at the endpoints as long as the singularity is integrable
(for example, a log(x) or 1/sqrt(x) singularity).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For real-valued endpoints, the starting and/or
ending points may be infinite. (A coordinate transformation is
performed internally to map the infinite interval to a finite one.) </td>
