<p>One of the most common techniques to improve performance is to
reduce
memory allocation. The total amount of allocation can be measured
with <a class="reference internal"

 title="Base.@time"><code class="xref jl jl-obj docutils literal"><span
 class="pre">@time</span></code></a>
and <a class="reference internal"
 href="file:///C:/Users/Saito/Desktop/Julia/%83%7D%83j%83%85%83A%83%8B/Julia%20Documentation/Manual/stdlib/base.html#Base.@allocated"
 title="Base.@allocated"><code class="xref jl jl-obj docutils literal"><span
 class="pre">@allocated</span></code></a>,
and specific lines triggering
allocation can often be inferred from profiling via the cost of
garbage collection that these lines incur. However, sometimes it is
more efficient to directly measure the amount of memory allocated by
each line of code.</p>
<p>To measure allocation line-by-line, start Julia with the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--track-allocation=&lt;setting&gt;</span></code>
command-line option, for which you
can choose <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">none</span></code>
(the default, do not measure allocation), <code
 class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user</span></code>
(measure memory allocation everywhere except JuliaÅfs core code), or
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">all</span></code>
(measure memory allocation at each line of Julia code).
Allocation gets measured for each line of compiled code. When you quit
Julia, the cumulative results are written to text files with <code
 class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.mem</span></code>
appended after the file name, residing in the same directory as the
source file. Each line lists the total number of bytes allocated.
The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Coverage</span></code>
package contains some elementary analysis tools, for
example to sort the lines in order of number of bytes allocated.</p>
<p>In interpreting the results, there are a few important details.
Under
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">user</span></code>
setting, the first line of any function directly called
from the REPL will exhibit allocation due to events that happen in the
REPL code itself. More significantly, JIT-compilation also adds to
allocation counts, because much of JuliaÅfs compiler is written in
Julia (and compilation usually requires memory allocation). The
recommended procedure is to force compilation by executing all the
commands you want to analyze, then call <a class="reference internal"
 href="file:///C:/Users/Saito/Desktop/Julia/%83%7D%83j%83%85%83A%83%8B/Julia%20Documentation/Manual/stdlib/profile.html#Base.Profile.clear_malloc_data"
 title="Base.Profile.clear_malloc_data"><code
 class="xref jl jl-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">Profile.clear_malloc_data()</span></code></a>
to
reset all allocation counters. Finally, execute the desired commands
and quit Julia to trigger the generation of the <code
 class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.mem</span></code> files.</p>
